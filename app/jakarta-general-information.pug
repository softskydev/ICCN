                h2 Weather, Climate, & Seasons
                p The climate of Indonesia is almost entirely tropical. The uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia's area ensures that temperatures on land remain fairly constant, with the coastal plains averaging 28 °C, the inland and mountain areas averaging 26 °C, and the higher mountain regions, 23 °C. Temperature varies little from season to season, and Indonesia experiences relatively little change in the length of daylight hours from one season to the next. 

                p There are two seasons in Indonesia, Rainy and Dry, both of which are relative. While there is significant regional variation, in most of the country (including Java and Bali) the dry season is April to October, while the wet season is November to March. However, global warming has made the seasons less predictable.
                h2 Getting To Jakarta
